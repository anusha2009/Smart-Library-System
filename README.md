# Smart-Library-System
IOT Project

This project aims to redefine the library experience, making it more interactive, efficient, and
user-friendly. With RFID-enabled shelves and books and occupancy sensor-based heat maps,
the Smart Library offers a glimpse into the future of library services. These technologies not
only streamline library operations but also significantly improve the accessibility and enjoyment
of library resources for users. Through this project, we also aim to demonstrate the practical
applications and benefits of IoT in academic settings, showcasing how technology can be
harnessed to enhance learning and resource management.
