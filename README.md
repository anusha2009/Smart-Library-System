# Smart-Library-System
IOT Project

This project aims to redefine the library experience, making it more interactive, efficient, and
user-friendly. With RFID-enabled shelves and books and occupancy sensor-based heat maps,
the Smart Library offers a glimpse into the future of library services. These technologies not
only streamline library operations but also significantly improve the accessibility and enjoyment
of library resources for users. Through this project, we also aim to demonstrate the practical
applications and benefits of IoT in academic settings, showcasing how technology can be
harnessed to enhance learning and resource management.

This project mainly features two components:
1. RFID-Enabled Shelves and Books
We have implemented the use of RFID technology that enables real-time tracking and
management of books, significantly improving inventory management and user
experience in locating books.
2. Occupancy Sensor-Based Heat Maps
The use of occupancy sensors facilitates the creation of dynamic heat maps. These
maps assist users in identifying less crowded areas, optimizing space utilization within
the library.

The file Smart-Library represents the backend and the JSON file contains the NODE-RED UI flows of the application.
